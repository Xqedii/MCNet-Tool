**MCNet Tool is a simple program for checking server information.**

The program allows you to ping a server by its domain and then retrieve details such as its logo, MOTD, website likes, and DNS information. All the data is presented neatly in the panel, making it easy to use for testing purposes. Server information is sourced from the Minecraft Server Status API.
